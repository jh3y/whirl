* Animated favicon?
* Test NPM Publish, can we link to a specific tagged version or something?

`whirl` is a curation of CSS loading animations. It started as a drop in `CSS` file to get easy animations using `:pseudo` elements. It's now a collection of loading animations to use, take inspiration from, change and do what you want with üëç

### No CSS distro?
It's inefficient. It's likely an app will only use one or two loaders. Pulling them all into an app would be overkill. Most projects use some form of bundling making it possible to import a single loader's styles.

### Usage
You've got different options here. Easiest will be to grab the CSS or SASS direct and tweak to your needs. Or you could install whirl and import the styles you want.

```shell
npm i @jh3y/whirl
yarn add @jh3y/whirl
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be aware that opting for the latter of these options will likely mean having to override styles.
